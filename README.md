# Trader Assistant Mini MT4

Trader Assistant Mini MT4 is a code snippet that provides two functions to assist traders in their decision-making process: the Risk to Reward Ratio (R:R) Panel and the Trade Panel. This code is not developed by ForexRobotEasy and is only provided as a sample code that can work as described in the product.

## Risk to Reward Ratio (R:R) Panel

The function `CalculateRR` calculates the risk to reward ratio based on the potential loss and potential profit provided. The formula used to calculate the ratio is `potentialProfit / potentialLoss`. The calculated ratio is then displayed using the `Print` function.

Example usage:
```
CalculateRR(100, 200); // Calculating the risk to reward ratio for potential losses of 100 and potential profits of 200
```

## Trade Panel

The function `DisplayTradePanel` displays the profit and loss in pips and percentages. It takes the profit and loss values as input and calculates the corresponding pips and percentages. The calculated values are then displayed using the `Print` function.

Example usage:
```
DisplayTradePanel(50, 25); // Displaying the trade panel for a profit of 50 and a loss of 25
```

## Product Description

By inputting the profit and loss values, traders can see the corresponding pips and percentages for their trades. This information is vital for evaluating the performance of trades and identifying areas for improvement.
